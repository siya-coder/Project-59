        <p> I liked to dance since I was five years old.I learn a beautiful dance called Kathak from my guru Mrs.Bhavana Sanjeev Lele since I was in senior.Kathak is my art and I respect it.I participate in dance programs.In kathak most of songs,kavittas and taal are dedicated to lord Krishna.I have participated in a dance called maakhanchori,it tells the story of how lord krishna and his friends stealed and ate the maakhan.I really enjoyed the dance.Ohh! I forgot to tell that I participated in one more dance called madhurashtakam its a big name,it tells that everything of lord Krishna was so beautiful.I learn this dance form since 8 years!!.</p>
